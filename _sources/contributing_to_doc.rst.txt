Welcome to ``fre-cli``'s Documentation-documentation- where we document how the documentation is
documented

How to Contribute to ``fre-cli``'s documentation
================================================



fork and poke at the settings
-----------------------------

* Fork ``fre-cli`` on github
	 
* On github, navigate to your ``fre-cli`` fork, and click “settings”
	 
* In “settings”, click “pages”
	 
* In “pages”, under “build and deployment”, make sure “source” is set to “Deploy from a branch”
	 
* Under that, find “Branch”, make sure the branch selected is ``gh-pages``
	 
* The branch ``gh-pages`` is "automagic”- i.e. do not change anything about it nor create a new one,
  nor interact with anything in that branch directly


enable workflows for your fork
------------------------------

note: this step may depend on user-specific settings!
	 
* Back on top where you found “settings”, find and click “actions” to the left
	 
* Enable running the workflow actions assoc with the ``fre-cli`` repo under ``.github/workflows``


run your fork's first workflow
------------------------------

* The documentation builds as the last steps to ``create_test_conda_env.yml`` when theres a push to ``main``
	 
* To get your first workflow run on your fork, comment out the ``github.ref == ‘refs/heads/main’`` bit
  so that it runs when you push to any branch, and make a small, trivial, commit somewhere to your
  remote fork
	 
* You should be able to find the deployed webpage from a successful workflow at
  https://your_username.github.io/fre-cli (if you did not change the fork’s name from ``fre-cli``, that is)
	 
* If you’re only editing docs, you can make the turn-around time on your workflow ~3 min faster by
  commenting-out the ``pylint`` and ``pytest`` steps in ``create_test_conda_env.yml``, and disable running the
  ``build_conda.yml`` workflow
